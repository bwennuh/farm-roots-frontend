## About Farm Roots

Farm Roots is an online farmers market app - designed to allow farms (or rather, the farmers) to upload their current produce options to be able to sell directly to consumers.

Farm Roots has two types of users - the farms (re: farmers) and the consumers (re: anyone who wants to buy some fresh produce!). When logging in, a user is to specify whether or not they're logging in as a farmer, which will dictate their home feed.

If a consumer does not currently have an account with Farm Roots, they can sign up as a new user to be able to start using the app.

If a farm is not currently a part of the Farm Roots database, farmers can fill out a new farm form in order to get the farm's data added to the app & start adding in the farm's produce information.

## Farms and Farmers

When a farmer logs in to the app, their home feed will contain all of the products that are currenly in the harvest season for their farm. Farmers will also have the option to edit any of the current products if any information needs updating (example: price).

Additionally, farmers can add more produce to their farm's page, and can specify the harvest dates for the product. This allows the farm to keep track of all of their produce year round, and not just for what's currently in season.

## Consumers

When a consumer logs in to the app, their home feed will contain all of the farms currently listed in the database. They will be able to click on any of the farms in order to view that farm's current produce selection.

For any of the produce available from any of the farms, consumers will have the option to add the products to their shopping cart in order to purchase. They will also have the option to view and edit their cart, should any of the products need to be removed from the cart or updated in quantity.
